## Features

- Add and withdraw funds
- Search for stocks using the AlphaVantage API
- Display financial data and stock price history on a graph
- Persistence of funds and favorite stocks using User Defaults

## Architecture

The app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which promotes a clear separation of concerns and enhances testability.

## About

This project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with iOS development concepts, SwiftUI, and the MVVM architecture. It incorporates features like funds management, third party API integration for stock data, displaying historical stock price trends on a graph, and data persistence.

Stock price history data is retrieved using the AlphaVantage API.
